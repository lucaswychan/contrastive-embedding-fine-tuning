Among his patients were Robert A. Brown and his two minor children, who had been visiting Dr. Reinholds for their dental needs. One day, a dispute arose when Dr. Reinholds billed Mr. Brown $600 for a dental crown that Mr. Brown claimed he never received nor agreed to pay for. Unwilling to let the bill go unpaid, Dr. Reinholds sought the assistance of Stewart Mortensen, operating under the name Credit Bureau Services, a debt collection agency.Mortensen took on the case with the intent to collect the alleged debt. In the process of this collection effort, Mortensen found it necessary to contact various consumer reporting agencies – Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion – to report Mr. Brown’s supposed delinquency. However, in doing so, he disclosed more than just the existence of an unpaid bill. He provided these agencies with extensive personal and medical information about Mr. Brown and his children, including their names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, telephone numbers, and their entire dental history under Dr. Reinholds' care. This information encompassed details of dental treatments they had received, painting a comprehensive picture of their medical interactions with the dentist.Crucially, at no point did Mr. Brown authorize the disclosure of such sensitive information.

She claimed he struck her in the head three times, dragged her to the edge of a cliff, and threw her over. Miraculously, despite her injuries, Lisa managed to find her way to Route 52, where she sought help, alleging her husband had attempted to murder her. Shortly after this alleged assault, Charles himself experienced a fall from a cliff, resulting in serious injuries that necessitated his airlift to Eastern Maine Medical Center. Over several days, he received medical treatment at this facility.The events leading to and following this incident prompted law enforcement to investigate Charles for attempted murder and aggravated assault. As part of their investigation, the State aimed to access Charles's medical records from the time he was admitted to the hospital immediately following the incident. However, Charles declined to voluntarily release these records to the prosecution. Consequently, the State, asserting a need for these records to advance their case, secured a search warrant from the District Court. This warrant compelled Eastern Maine Medical Center to provide Charles's medical records spanning from April 7 to April 15, 2011.This legal move sparked a contentious debate centered around the privacy of medical records and the rights of individuals versus the needs of law enforcement. Charles contended that the State's action to obtain his medical records via a search warrant, rather than through a subpoena process that might offer more protective measures for his privacy, was improper. He argued that this method of obtaining his confidential medical records was not only illegal but also violated his constitutional rights.

This accident prompted an immediate response from the Arizona Department of Public Safety, including Trooper Saleem Abdullah.Upon arrival, Trooper Abdullah observed significant evidence of the crash, including blood within the driver's area of the vehicle, indicative of injuries sustained by the occupants. Vernon Peltz and his mother, J.K., were found in a state of distress, with Peltz displaying visible injuries and signs of intoxication, including a cut above his eye and blood on his hands, alongside his red, watery eyes and a flushed face.In the aftermath, medical technicians swiftly transported Peltz and his mother to nearby hospitals for urgent care. Trooper Abdullah, keen on gathering evidence pertinent to the accident, followed Peltz to the hospital. It was here that a pivotal moment occurred; a nurse informed Abdullah that a blood sample would be drawn from Peltz for medical purposes. Seizing the opportunity, Abdullah requested a portion of this sample to determine Peltz's blood alcohol content (BAC), a critical piece of evidence for the investigation.As Abdullah waited in a common area of the hospital, near the nurses' station and outside Peltz's room, he overheard Peltz engaging in a phone conversation. Peltz candidly admitted to having consumed ""a few alcoholic drinks"" before driving. This overheard admission, coupled with the subsequent BAC results showing a level of .142, significantly bolstered the case against Peltz, leading to charges of aggravated assault and DUI.This scenario underscores the complex interplay between healthcare providers' roles, law enforcement duties, and the paramount importance of patient privacy.

The explosion killed Louis Riccio, who had been hired by the homeowners, Salvatore and Rose Vas-sallo, to take care of their property while they vacationed in Sicily. The blast also damaged 15 neighboring homes.On September 30, 1997, this Court signed a search warrant for the Wilson Road location. On October 1,1997, the Court signed a search warrant for Riccio’s home, which is located at 837 North DuPont Street, Wilmington, Delaware. On October 15, 1997, the search warrants were returned, and the State filed a motion to seal the warrants, the affidavits of probable cause, and the returns for a period of 90 days. After reviewing the documents, this Court granted the State’s motion to seal.On October 16, 1997, The News Journal Company (hereafter referred to as “Interve-nor” or “News Journal”) filed a motion to intervene, a motion to expedite proceedings, and a motion to unseal the documents connected with the searches of the two homes. Because no rule or statute precludes such intervention, and, in fact, Delaware courts have generally allowed it, this Court granted the motion to intervene and the motion to expedite the proceedings. See Gannett Co., Inc. v. State, Del.Supr., 565 A.2d 895, 899 (1989) (“Gannett I”); Van Arsdall v. State, Del.Supr., 486 A.2d 1 (1984); State v. Shipley, Del.Super., 497 A2d 1052 (1985). The State filed its memorandum opposing the motion to unseal on October 23, 1997. On October 24, 1997, the Court heard oral argument on the motion to unseal. The issues are now ripe for decision.II. ISSUESThe News Journal argues first that it has a “presumed right of access” to pre-indictment search warrants and supporting documentation under both the First Amendment and the common law and that the result of the analysis is the same under either standard. (Intervenor’s Memorandum at 10, hereafter referred to as “Int. Mem. at page no.”). The State responds that every court that has addressed this issue has denied the press access to sealed pre-indictment search warrant documentation. (State’s Memorandum at 1, hereafter referred to as “St. Mem. at page no.”).Second, the News Journal contends that even if the Court finds no First Amendment or common law right of access to the search warrant documentation, the Court should excise sensitive portions of the documentation and release a redacted version. (Int. Mem. at 6.)Finally, the News Journal argues that before a court may issue an order depriving the public of its First Amendment rights, the court must give notice of the proposed order and allow interested parties to be heard so that they may challenge the order.

As Officer Pearce approached McDonald, he noticed a gun on the floor of the car. Because McDonald had previously been convicted of a felony, he was charged under § 922(g)(1) for being a felon in possession of a firearm. McDonald moved to suppress evidence pertaining to the gun, initially arguing that the officers should not have pulled him over because the anonymous tip alone was not sufficient evidence to provide probable cause to stop him. The government responded, however, that McDonald was actually stopped because he used his turn signal but never turned onto a different street. The officers believed that was a traffic offense under 625 111. Comp. Stat. 5/ll-804(d) (2005). McDonald responded that § 5/11— 804 did not prohibit his actions and that Officer Pearce’s mistake of law could not justify a traffic stop.Officer Pearce testified at the hearing on the motion, stating that the police received a tip claiming that a black male driving a maroon Buick possessed drugs and a handgun. Later that night, the officers saw a car matching that description and began to follow it. When the driver flashed his turn signal at a ninety-degree curve in the road where the road changed names, Officer Pearce stopped the car. He testified that he consulted his “Offense Code Book” (a guide for police officers that catalogs traffic laws), which listed an offense for “Improper use of turn signal” — the book contained a citation to § ll-804(d) but provided neither the statutory language nor any further description of the offense. Officer Pearce concluded that McDonald did not need to use his turn signal at the bend in the road and that he must have improperly used the signal.The district court ruled that the anonymous tip would probably not have been a sufficient ground to stop McDonald, but that the stop was warranted because Officer Pearce reasonably believed McDonald’s use of the turn signal was a violation of state law. The district court also stated in a footnote that although the statute does not specifically proscribe McDonald’s use of the turn signal, “it could, arguably, be so interpreted.” The court denied the motion to suppress.

Plaintiff replied on August 23, 2002.II. Standard of ReviewThe Scheduling Order set May 9, 2002 as the deadline for all motions to join parties and amend pleadings. Plaintiff filed her motion on August 7, 2002. Plaintiffs motion to amend her complaint after the deadline triggers both Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) governing amendments to pleadings and Fed. R.Civ.P. 16(b) governing modification to a scheduling order. The standards for satisfying the rules are at odds. Rule 15(a) states, in pertinent part, that “... leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.” According to Rule 16(b) however, “[a] schedule shall not be modified except upon a showing of good cause and by leave of the district judge....”Neither the Fourth Circuit nor the Supreme Court has dealt decisively with the interplay of these two rules when a motion to amend is made after the deadline set in the scheduling order has passed. However, one district court in the Fourth Circuit set up a “two step” analysis:Once the scheduling order’s deadline for amendment of the pleadings has passed, a moving party first must satisfy the good cause standard of Rule 16(b). If the moving party satisfies Rule 16(b), the movant then must pass the tests for amendment under 15(a).Marcum v. Zimmer, 163 F.R.D. 250, 254 (S.D.W.Va.1995); see also Johnson v.

When Gallant appealed, the Board released two letters written by NLRB Chairman James Stephens to individuals in the Office of the President, urging Cracraft’s renomination to prevent any slowdown in the NLRB’s case processing.

She alleges that First National accessed her consumer report and used a consumer reporting agency to target certain people, e.g., individuals with poor credit or individuals who recently obtained bankruptcy discharges, for sub-prime credit offers.Perry alleged in her complaint that First National violated 15 U.S.C. § 1681m(d) by failing to include a “clear and conspicuous” statement of certain disclosures required by the FCRA. Perry tried to introduce the report of Timothy Shanahan (“Shanahan report”), a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago, to support her argument that the Notice was not “clear and conspicuous.” The Shanahan report included a “legibility analysis.”The district court found that Perry did not have a statutory right to bring a private cause of action under § 1681m(d), due to a 2003 amendment to the FCRA that eliminated the right to bring such actions.

After business hours on July 26, 2006, and August 7, 2006, aluminum wheels, radiators, and condensers were stolen from West Imports, a Henry County scrap metal business. The thefts were captured on the business’ videotape surveillance system. No one at West Imports could identify the perpetrator who was observed committing larceny on the July 26 videotape, but the business’ owner, George Westmoreland, believed he recognized someone named “Michael or Mike” on the videotape from August 7, 2006. This individual had previously sold scrap metal to Westmoreland on several occasions. One of Westmoreland’s employees, who also watched the August 7 videotape, recognized the thief as his neighbor on Jones Ridge Road.Westmoreland contacted the police early on the morning of August 8, 2006, and gave this information to Sergeant Troy Easter. Sergeant Easter, after viewing the August 7 videotape, then went to appellant’s home on Jones Ridge Road, approximately two miles from the business. When he arrived at the home between 7:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., Sergeant Easter observed numerous car parts and some apparently inoperable vehicles sitting in the yard around the house. The house had no fencing around it, and the property was not posted with any “no trespassing” signs.Sergeant Easter approached the front door and knocked, but no one answered. The sergeant then walked around the left side of the house and knocked on a side door. No one answered. Sergeant Easter then walked to the back of the house to see “if anybody might be around the back.” As he walked into the backyard, he observed wheels and radiators like those stolen from West Imports sitting both in the open and behind a red shed situated on the opposite side of the yard, approximately twenty-five to thirty yards behind the house. The backyard was cluttered with a variety of other car parts. The red shed was the only structure in the yard.Sergeant Easter then returned to the front of the house in order to call Westmoreland from his patrol car and ask him to come to the house on Jones Ridge Road. At this point, appellant came out of the house. When Westmoreland arrived at the house, he identified the tires, radiators, and condensers in the backyard as the stolen items.Appellant moved to suppress the evidence of the stolen goods and any derivative evidence, including appellant’s subsequent confession to the July 26 theft and the August 7 theft, contending that Sergeant Easter conducted a warrantless search of his property in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The trial court found that Sergeant Easter was lawfully in appellant’s backyard trying to see if appellant was home that morning so as to question him when Sergeant Easter observed the stolen items in plain view.

 'After business hours on July 26, 2006, and August 7, 2006, aluminum wheels, radiators, and condensers were stolen from West Imports, a Henry County scrap metal business. The thefts were captured on the business’ videotape surveillance system.'
 'No one at West Imports could identify the perpetrator who was observed committing larceny on the July 26 videotape, but the business’ owner, George Westmoreland, believed he recognized someone named “Michael or Mike” on the videotape from August 7, 2006.'
 'This individual had previously sold scrap metal to Westmoreland on several occasions.'
 'One of Westmoreland’s employees, who also watched the August 7 videotape, recognized the thief as his neighbor on Jones Ridge Road.Westmoreland contacted the police early on the morning of August 8, 2006, and gave this information to Sergeant Troy Easter.'
 'Sergeant Easter, after viewing the August 7 videotape, then went to appellant’s home on Jones Ridge Road, approximately two miles from the business.'
 'When he arrived at the home between 7:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., Sergeant Easter observed numerous car parts and some apparently inoperable vehicles sitting in the yard around the house.'
 'The house had no fencing around it, and the property was not posted with any “no trespassing” signs.Sergeant Easter approached the front door and knocked, but no one answered.'
 'The sergeant then walked around the left side of the house and knocked on a side door. No one answered.'
 'Sergeant Easter then walked to the back of the house to see “if anybody might be around the back.”'
 'As he walked into the backyard, he observed wheels and radiators like those stolen from West Imports sitting both in the open and behind a red shed situated on the opposite side of the yard, approximately twenty-five to thirty yards behind the house.'
 'The backyard was cluttered with a variety of other car parts.'
 'The red shed was the only structure in the yard.Sergeant Easter then returned to the front of the house in order to call Westmoreland from his patrol car and ask him to come to the house on Jones Ridge Road. At this point, appellant came out of the house.'
 'When Westmoreland arrived at the house, he identified the tires, radiators, and condensers in the backyard as the stolen items.'
 'Appellant moved to suppress the evidence of the stolen goods and any derivative evidence, including appellant’s subsequent confession to the July 26 theft and the August 7 theft,'
 'contending that Sergeant Easter conducted a warrantless search of his property in violation of the Fourth Amendment.'
 'The trial court found that Sergeant Easter was lawfully in appellant’s backyard trying to see if appellant was home that morning so as to question him when Sergeant Easter observed the stolen items in plain view.'
 'The trial court ruled that the plain view doctrine was applicable in this case, and, therefore, the court denied appellant’s suppression motion.'

The Times asked for a duplicate of the tape. NASA declined that request, but it did provide the Times with a transcript of the tape. In a letter to the Times, NASA claimed that giving the news media a copy of the audio tape itself would subject the astronauts’ families “to hearing the voices of their loved ones, an intrusion on their grief which would certainly exacerbate feelings of hurt and loss.” Unsatisfied, the Times filed suit in the district court, invoking the FOIA.In the district court the Times claimed that “a voice communication tape is essential to fully understand an aircraft accident and to evaluate appropriate corrective measures.” “The tape,” the Times argued, “contains important information which NASA’s transcript — even if it were totally accurate — cannot bring to public light,” including the astronauts’ “voice inflections.” Listening to the tape, the Times contended, will enable the public to verify NASA’s conclusion that “the astronauts had no advance warning of a problem and that the sounds from the engines were not ‘unusual.’ ” It also pointed out that the words spoken on the tape (as revealed in the transcript) contain no personal information about the astronauts or their families.

The trial court consolidated the offenses into one judgment and imposed a sentence in the presumptive range of 192 to 291 months in prison. The trial court also ordered defendant to enroll in lifetime sex offender registration and in lifetime SBM. The evidentiary basis for defendant's plea as presented by the State tended to show the following facts.On 11 November 2015, Anna's mother reported to the New Hanover County Sheriff's Department that Anna had snuck out of the house the night before and was missing. Responding detectives began searching for Anna at her friends' houses. One friend provided Anna's Facebook account and password, and a detective saw some messages between her and another person, later identified as defendant. Anna's friends also reported that they had seen Anna and defendant meet multiple times at a local ice skating rink. That afternoon, an employee at Wave Transit Station in Wilmington called 9-1-1 to report that there were three young people in the area. Responding patrol officers identified two of the people as defendant and Anna, who were then interviewed by the New Hanover County Sheriff's Department.During her interview, Anna reported that after she met defendant, they started communicating online, and she snuck out of her house on the night of 10 November 2015 to be with him. Defendant attempted to rent them a hotel room, but he only had cash, and both hotels only accepted credit cards. She and defendant then had sex in the parking lot and talked about leaving town together, before they were picked up at the bus station. In defendant's interview, he admitted to having sex with Anna and corroborated her version of the events.After the trial court accepted defendant's plea and rendered its sentence on the offenses, the State applied for the imposition of lifetime registration and SBM. Defense counsel objected to both registration and SBM. After the trial court found defendant had committed an aggravating offense under the registration and SBM statutes, it summarily concluded that defendant ""require[s] the highest possible level of supervision and monitoring"" and ordered that he enroll in lifetime registration and be subject to lifetime SBM. Over defendant's objections to the registration and SBM orders, the trial court acknowledged that his guilty plea was contingent upon reserving his right to appeal those orders.

 ""Responding detectives began searching for Anna at her friends' houses. One friend provided Anna's Facebook account and password, and a detective saw some messages between her and another person, later identified as defendant.""
 ""Anna's friends also reported that they had seen Anna and defendant meet multiple times at a local ice skating rink.""

 'Defendant attempted to rent them a hotel room, but he only had cash, and both hotels only accepted credit cards.'

 ""In defendant's interview, he admitted to having sex with Anna and corroborated her version of the events.""

Madden NFL allows users to play virtual football games between National Football League (NFL) teams by controlling virtual players, or avatars. EA’s graphic artists and programmers create the avatars, as well as virtual stadiums, coaches, referees, fans and other audio and visual elements that allow users to experience a realistic simulation of an NFL game. Users control the movements of the avatars and the outcome of the game through the users’ inputs to the game system.Each annual version of Madden NFL includes all current players for all 32 NFL teams, along with accurate player names, team logos, colors and uniforms. EA has paid National Football Players Inc.—the licensing arm of the National Football League Players Association—annual licensing fees in the millions of dollars to use current players’ likenesses.From 2001 through 2009, Madden NFL also included certain particularly successful or popular “historic teams.” EA did not obtain a license to use the likenesses of the former players on these historic teams. Although the players on the historic teams are not identified by name or photograph, each is described by his position, years in the NFL, height, weight, skin tone and relative skill level in different aspects of the sport. For example, Madden NFL includes as a historic team the 1979 Los Angeles Rams that played in that year’s Super Bowl. Vince Ferragamo, a plaintiff in this action, was a quarterback on the 1979 Rams. He is Caucasian and was listed in the 1979 Rams media guide as a 26 year-old, six-foot three-inch, 207-pound third-year NFL player. Madden NFL depicts an avatar who is a quarterback for the 1979 Rams and has identical physical characteristics. Madden NFL also includes the 1984 Los Angeles Rams, for which Ferragamo was again a quarterback. The 1984 Rams media guide lists Ferragamo as a 30-year-old, six-foot three-inch, 212-pound seventh-year NFL player. Madden NFL depicts an avatar on the 1984 Rams with identical physical characteristics.The plaintiffs alleged that Madden NFL similarly includes, without authorization, accurate likenesses of plaintiffs Michael Davis and Billy Joe Dupree, as well as roughly 6,000 other former NFL players who appear on more than 100 historic teams in various editions of Madden NFL. The plaintiffs asserted claims for right of publicity under California Civil Code § 3344 and California common law, conversion, trespass to chattels and unjust enrichment on behalf of themselves and all former NFL players depicted in Madden NFL.

 'Users control the movements of the avatars and the outcome of the game through the users’ inputs to the game system.'
 'Each annual version of Madden NFL includes all current players for all 32 NFL teams, along with accurate player names, team logos, colors and uniforms.'
 'EA has paid National Football Players Inc.—the licensing arm of the National Football League Players Association—annual licensing fees in the millions of dollars to use current players’ likenesses.'
 'From 2001 through 2009, Madden NFL also included certain particularly successful or popular “historic teams.” EA did not obtain a license to use the likenesses of the former players on these historic teams.'
 'Although the players on the historic teams are not identified by name or photograph, each is described by his position, years in the NFL, height, weight, skin tone and relative skill level in different aspects of the sport.'
 'For example, Madden NFL includes as a historic team the 1979 Los Angeles Rams that played in that year’s Super Bowl.'
 'Vince Ferragamo, a plaintiff in this action, was a quarterback on the 1979 Rams. He is Caucasian and was listed in the 1979 Rams media guide as a 26 year-old, six-foot three-inch, 207-pound third-year NFL player.'
 'Madden NFL depicts an avatar who is a quarterback for the 1979 Rams and has identical physical characteristics.'
 'Madden NFL also includes the 1984 Los Angeles Rams, for which Ferragamo was again a quarterback.'
 'The 1984 Rams media guide lists Ferragamo as a 30-year-old, six-foot three-inch, 212-pound seventh-year NFL player.'
 'Madden NFL depicts an avatar on the 1984 Rams with identical physical characteristics.'
 'The plaintiffs alleged that Madden NFL similarly includes, without authorization, accurate likenesses of plaintiffs Michael Davis and Billy Joe Dupree, as well as roughly 6,'
 '000 other former NFL players who appear on more than 100 historic teams in various editions of Madden NFL.'
 'The plaintiffs asserted claims for right of publicity under California Civil Code § 3344 and California common law, conversion, trespass to chattels and unjust enrichment on behalf of themselves and all former NFL players depicted in Madden NFL.'

At the scene officers found Patricia standing with a neighbor on the front lawn of her home. She told the officers that Henderson had choked her and then threw her out of the house after learning she had called 911. Patricia had noticeable red marks around her neck that substantiated her story.The Hendersons’ teenage son arrived shortly after the police and gave them a key to the home. Before the police entered, Patricia told them that Henderson had weapons in the house and had a history of drug and gun arrests. Patricia said she was willing to file a complaint against Henderson and wanted him arrested. The parties dispute whether or not Patricia also told the officers, prior to their entering the house, that she wanted the house searched.The police used the key to enter the house and found Henderson in the living room. After a brief exchange, Henderson told the officers to “[g]et the [expletive] out of my house” — which the district court reasonably construed as an objection to a search. Henderson was then arrested for domestic battery and taken to the police station. Patricia was still outside and did not observe Henderson’s encounter with the police. A few minutes after Henderson was taken to the station, Patricia agreed to a search of the home and signed a consent form.Patricia led the officers to the attic where they discovered crack cocaine and drug-dealing paraphernalia, four handguns, a shotgun, a rifle, a machine gun, and live rounds of ammunition. In the basement they found a machete, a crossbow, and more ammunition, as well as an M-1000 explosive device. Patricia suggested that the officers also search the family car, and she signed another consent form.

 'At the scene officers found Patricia standing with a neighbor on the front lawn of her home. She told the officers that Henderson had choked her and then threw her out of the house after learning she had called 911.'
 'Patricia had noticeable red marks around her neck that substantiated her story.'
 'The Hendersons’ teenage son arrived shortly after the police and gave them a key to the home. Before the police entered, Patricia told them that Henderson had weapons in the house and had a history of drug and gun arrests.'
 'Patricia said she was willing to file a complaint against Henderson and wanted him arrested. The parties dispute whether or not Patricia also told the officers, prior to their entering the house, that she wanted the house searched.'
 'The police used the key to enter the house and found Henderson in the living room. After a brief exchange, Henderson told the officers to “[g]et the [expletive] out of my house” — which the district court reasonably construed as an objection to a search.'
 'Henderson was then arrested for domestic battery and taken to the police station.'
 'Patricia was still outside and did not observe Henderson’s encounter with the police.'
 'A few minutes after Henderson was taken to the station, Patricia agreed to a search of the home and signed a consent form.'
 'Patricia led the officers to the attic where they discovered crack cocaine and drug-dealing paraphernalia, four handguns, a shotgun, a rifle, a machine gun, and live rounds of ammunition.'
 'In the basement they found a machete, a crossbow, and more ammunition, as well as an M-1000 explosive device.'
 'Patricia suggested that the officers also search the family car, and she signed another consent form.'
